# overlayed

This is an electron based overlay application for Discord that leverages the local [RPC websocket](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/rpc).

With this app you can view who talking in your current channel.
### Why not just use the native overlay

Mainly because the native overlay only supports games. 

1. You can use this in any game (windowed borderless mode)
1. You can use this in any application
